  "description": "The CEO, Jeff Blumba, has several secretaries who are overbooked and have too many events in their backlog to plan for Jeff. Your job is to design an API to be triggered by an auto event manager (assume that service is already implemented). This API should be able to poll for existing events, check event status, create events based on open time slots on the CEO's calendar, and update events.",
